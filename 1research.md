<u>Advertising, Brand Preferences and Market Structure (Job Market Paper)</u>

Abstract: This paper explores how innovations in advertising technology reshape consumers' brand preferences -- propensity to purchase certain brands over others despite of similar prices -- and contribute to changes in the aggregate market structure. Using a novel firm-level data set, I document that aggregate concentration and markup has decreased by 10% and 5% respectively between 2010 and 2016. Empirical evidence also reveals significant changes to the cost structures of the advertising industry during the same period. I then construct a multi-product, multi-sector heterogeneous firm model with endogenous advertising and entry/exit decisions, and structurally estimate model parameters from data. Counterfactual analysis suggests that if the advertising cost structure has not changed during the sample period, U.S. aggregate markup and Herfindahl would both *increase*.
