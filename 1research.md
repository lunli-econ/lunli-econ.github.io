Abstract: This paper explores how advertising technology innovations reshape consumers' brand preferences – propensity to purchase certain brands over others despite similar prices – and contribute to changes in consumer packaged goods' market structures. Using a novel firm-level data set, I document that the average concentration and markup have decreased by 10% and 5%, respectively, between 2010 and 2016. Empirical evidence also reveals significant changes to the cost structures of the advertising industry during the same period. I then construct a multi-product, multi-sector heterogeneous firm model with endogenous advertising and entry/exit decisions and structurally estimate model parameters from data. Counterfactual analysis suggests that if the advertising cost structure has not changed during the sample period, the average markup and Herfindahl will *increase*.

Abstract: Based on item level micro-data collected from around 35,000 U.S. supermarkets from 2006 to 2016, I compare different approaches to construct location-specific price indexes from scanner data sets and propose a method that generates unbiased, free of “chain drift” indexes while staying computationally feasible. I show that the resulting indexes are consistent with official statistics released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and discuss ways to treat missing data in the process. My results show significant regional variations in inflation rates across U.S. locations from 2006 to 2016: cities have lower inflation rates than rural areas. This finding potentially raises new questions on the effect of central banks’ monetary policies on regional inflation rates.
