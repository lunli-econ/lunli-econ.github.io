      <p>I'm an assistant professor at Peking University, School of Economics.
        I received my PhD from University of Chicago in 2021. <br><br>
        Broadly speaking, my research focuses on the role of imperfect information on consumer behavior, firm dynamics, and other aggregate economic outcomes.
        I'm currently interested in topics such as inflation, price dispersion, media, advertising, and the digital economy.
