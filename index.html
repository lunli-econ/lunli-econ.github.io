      <p>I'm an assistant professor at Peking University, School of Economics.
        I received my PhD from University of Chicago in 2021.
        Broadly speaking, my research focuses on the role of imperfect information on consumer behavior, firm dynamics, and other aggregate outcomes.
        I'm currently interested in topics such as inflation and price dispersion, media and advertising, and the digital economy.
